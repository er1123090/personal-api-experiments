They're looking for ride-sharing options, but they haven't specified a destination in this utterance. I have to look at past sessions to infer some information.\n\nFirst, I examined past sessions and noticed the user consistently requests a ride-sharing service (`shared_ride=\"True\"`) and only needs one seat (`number_of_seats=\"1\"`).  That's a pretty strong pattern.  The destination, however, changes every time, so I can't infer anything there. The prompt said, \"Apply Inferred Preferences: Fill in slots based on the preferences found in Step 1, unless the user explicitly overrides them in the current utterance.\"\n\nLooking at the prompt's API schema, \"destination\" is still a required slot. And \"number_of_seats\" is specified to be of type \"integer/string.\" I confirmed the prompt and past history, the user always sets shared to `True` and the number of seats to `\"1\"`.\n\nThe current utterance, \"I need a ride and want to check available ride-sharing options,\" doesn't provide the crucial \"destination\" information. But it also doesn't provide info for number of seats, or share ride. Therefore, I'll default to the inferred preferences from the previous sessions, assuming the user continues to want a single, shared ride.\n\nSo the call should be `GetRideSharing(number_of_seats=\"1\", shared_ride=True)`."}
